# UltraQC

Welcome to our project, UltraQC. UltraQC was developed as a TU Delft Context Project in Bioinformatics. 
Our project aims to create an automated program that filters DNA samples to only useful ones. Our endgoal is to
create a new QC system to assist analysists to determine the quality of DNA samples.
